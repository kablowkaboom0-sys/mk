# G10 retail-track completion matrix

Date: 2026-08-29

This directory indexes PRD row 22. Raw state traces and staff inputs remain
private and ignored. A track is marked Pass only when native execution reaches a
real finish transition; boot screenshots do not qualify.

## Moo Moo Meadows exact run

- Product: sole native arm64 KartPad process; no Dolphin and no Simulator.
- Retail UI path: Time Trials → Mushroom Cup → Moo Moo Meadows → regular
  Nintendo staff data `Nin★YuNya 01:37.856` → Watch Replay.
- Private trace SHA-256:
  `b61dc910a085a09c0e62c252a9cd516223cde46d6fb175ce201b8154f719b572`.
- Strict assertion:
  `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 6106`.
- Result: first completed segment begins at race time 240, ends at 6105,
  contains 5,866 consecutive stage-2 samples, and is followed by stage 4.

The first attempt visually finished but produced no trace because its absolute
output directory did not exist. Runtime output explicitly said `unable to open`;
that run is rejected. The directory was created and the changed run above passed.

Eight unrelated `dolrecomp` workers were active during both runs. Their load
affected the FPS overlay and audio queue, so neither performance nor audio is
accepted from this evidence. Guest stage progression and exact input-frame
completion are independent of that wall-clock contention.

## Mushroom Gorge exact run

- Product: sole native arm64 KartPad process; no Dolphin and no Simulator.
- Executable SHA-256: `f6b40a3902ac5ba559d359c5b1cb5488176ebf14bc8eab3da1371c1fd146f9fc`.
- Retail UI path: Time Trials → Mushroom Cup → Mushroom Gorge → regular Nintendo staff data `Nin★Murak 02:16.110` → Watch Replay.
- Original accepted private trace SHA-256: `e20883a2ca6cdfda1bb1f3da75535b852006a44ac87b833c46787ceea88277e4`. After the GUI-helper filename incident described below, a process-local rerun restored the convenience trace with SHA-256 `5aa1026555f10dc683c68fb80476ad077a641e4ab30669f50bebdbb43d3419b5` and the same exact accepted stage/frame boundary.
- Strict assertion: `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 8399`.
- Result: the accepted segment begins at race time 240, ends at 8398, contains 8,159 consecutive stage-2 samples, and is followed by stage 4. The later incomplete segment is the retail automatic replay loop and is not accepted as a second run.
- The focused UI observations remained at 60.0 FPS, but this trace run is accepted only for guest-stage completion; it is not a G11 frame-pacing sample. The known writable-cache bundle-seal issue recurred after the run and remains separately tracked for G13.

## Toad's Factory exact run

- Product: sole native arm64 KartPad process; no Dolphin and no Simulator.
- Executable SHA-256: `3927307a33dd9cac30237906489b4423fd7a11ba4ccc3d81f54efbd15281b5d6`.
- Retail UI path: Time Trials → Mushroom Cup → Toad's Factory → regular Nintendo staff data `Nin★Misa 02:22.480` → Watch Replay.
- Private trace SHA-256: `259abe8ae52bf1a54b069ded79fbd41cf816fd82dde2fea45a546254d6a58495`.
- Strict assertion: `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 8781`.
- Result: the accepted segment begins at race time 240, ends at 8780, contains 8,541 consecutive stage-2 samples, and is followed by stage 4. A later incomplete segment is the retail automatic replay loop.
- Harness note: the persistent GUI launch helper retained the preceding Mushroom Gorge trace path, so this run initially overwrote that ignored filename. The completed contents were validated and moved to `toads-factory-native.csv` after the process closed. `scripts/launch-g10-traced-runtime.sh` now binds the path in the runtime's own process, refuses relative/existing outputs and a second KartPad process, and restored the Mushroom Gorge convenience trace in an exact rerun.

## Mario Circuit exact run

- Product: sole native arm64 KartPad process launched with the process-local trace helper; no Dolphin and no Simulator.
- Executable SHA-256: `bc953f9e6642190a3bfe226558f69f1abfaed4416aeb1c9b7645caccc215ec82`.
- Retail UI path: Time Trials → Flower Cup → Mario Circuit → regular Nintendo staff data `Nin★==Kony 01:44.777` → Watch Replay.
- Private trace SHA-256: `621ffc9cb573aba276b1c51daa6a2a532970811331f38e999c14fe3f99ec6307`.
- Strict assertion: `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 6521`.
- Result: the accepted segment begins at race time 240, ends at 6520, contains 6,281 consecutive stage-2 samples, and is followed by stage 4. A later incomplete segment is the retail automatic replay loop.
- Capture-time FPS and audio drops under current host load are rejected; only exact guest-stage completion is accepted.

## Coconut Mall exact run

- Product: sole native arm64 KartPad process launched with the process-local trace helper; no Dolphin and no Simulator.
- Executable SHA-256: `1c2f73f9105d6f41a5ed617f1d22334cd0220bb011ccb010348a8da90635e069`.
- Retail UI path: Time Trials → Flower Cup → Coconut Mall → regular Nintendo staff data `Nin★♪SiM0 02:30.764` → Watch Replay.
- Private trace SHA-256: `64de24b8985da1e190aa8835fd47890253a265612c6c0795a880244af2664272`.
- Strict assertion: `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 9277`.
- Result: the accepted segment begins at race time 240, ends at 9276, contains 9,037 consecutive stage-2 samples, and is followed by stage 4. A later incomplete segment is the retail automatic replay loop.
- Focused observations reached 60 FPS across indoor/outdoor transitions, escalators, traffic, shadows, and reflective surfaces, but capture-time variance and audio drops under current host load are rejected from performance/audio acceptance.

## DK Summit exact run

- Product: sole native arm64 KartPad process launched with the process-local trace helper; no Dolphin and no Simulator.
- Executable SHA-256: `bfa5378f45b3a4eba30804d37cdcfb957f065ab34948d2ada17929d1d25e9e28`.
- Retail UI path: Time Trials → Flower Cup → DK's Snowboard Cross (PAL DK Summit) → regular Nintendo staff data `Nin★mokke 02:34.693` → Watch Replay.
- Private trace SHA-256: `7da9713d157958270635a4e27dd8e34eabe9b6095cdc0df46df018ce9f8dafee`.
- Strict assertion: `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 9513`.
- Result: the accepted segment begins at race time 240, ends at 9512, contains 9,273 consecutive stage-2 samples, and is followed by stage 4. A later incomplete segment is the retail automatic replay loop.
- Focused observations displayed 60 FPS across half-pipe, snow, ski-lift, jump, and trick sections; audio drops under host load keep this run out of performance/audio acceptance.

## Wario's Gold Mine exact run

- Product: sole native arm64 KartPad process launched with the process-local trace helper; no Dolphin and no Simulator.
- Executable SHA-256: `86d074650e352e266c50d3fc12489fd35854b3ac35d2968062e6ee316d8ddec6`.
- Retail UI path: Time Trials → Flower Cup → Wario's Gold Mine → regular Nintendo staff data `Nin★morimo 02:19.585` → Watch Replay.
- Private trace SHA-256: `25c25abdc17a5bcbcb09d016bb2b3b6e9a6f5df2e482649cba6d0c809a08f8ba`.
- Strict assertion: `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 8607`.
- Result: the accepted segment begins at race time 240, ends at 8606, contains 8,367 consecutive stage-2 samples, and is followed by stage 4. A later incomplete segment is the retail automatic replay loop.
- Focused observations displayed 60 FPS across ravines, mine interiors, moving carts, steam, branching rails, and dense wood geometry; audio drops keep this out of performance/audio acceptance.

## GCN Peach Beach exact run

- Product: sole native arm64 KartPad process launched with the process-local trace helper; no Dolphin and no Simulator.
- Executable SHA-256: `334e99a89cb1b061efb7f69bf7ab912e98f5661a361869152e76588912a70403`.
- Retail UI path: Time Trials → Shell Cup → GCN Peach Beach → regular Nintendo staff data `Nin★HIRO 01:34.233` → Watch Replay.
- Private trace SHA-256: `0cf22954bcaa8b59edea83c181abbff5bea735263759df13fa4f637bb9e60b85`.
- Strict assertion: `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 5889`.
- Result: the accepted segment begins at race time 240, ends at 5888, contains 5,649 consecutive stage-2 samples, and is followed by stage 4. A later incomplete segment is the retail automatic replay loop.
- Focused observations displayed 60 FPS across beach, surf, forest, item-obstacle, and translucent effect scenes; four audio drops under host load are rejected from audio acceptance.

## DS Yoshi Falls exact run

- Product: sole native arm64 KartPad process launched with the process-local trace helper; no Dolphin and no Simulator.
- Executable SHA-256: `ee4260df39e341dd1baecf8d74115e8f28ca770152d980a6aa635c74e59731b5`.
- Retail UI path: Time Trials → Shell Cup → DS Yoshi Falls → regular Nintendo staff data `Nin★DoTak 01:16.461` → Watch Replay.
- Private trace SHA-256: `9d52cf29f84851e183c9f4e4afe72531c8229f63ee0eb3431747ba0fea2fbe71`.
- Strict assertion: `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 4824`.
- Result: the accepted segment begins at race time 240, ends at 4823, contains 4,584 consecutive stage-2 samples, and is followed by stage 4. A later incomplete segment is the retail automatic replay loop.

Its bounded audio summary is clean through 81,920 checks and 31,456,896 submitted bytes, with zero empty observations or drops and an 8,684-byte maximum below the 15,360-byte limit. This supports gameplay continuity but does not by itself complete row 33's pause/device-change/long-session scope.

## SNES Ghost Valley 2 exact run

- Product: sole native arm64 KartPad process launched with the process-local trace helper; no Dolphin and no Simulator.
- Executable SHA-256: `d3ec1cfd25df859e19ad3332bfa7a539183c2d8f54371971c8a355a09cc2b046`.

- Strict assertion: `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 6568`.
- Result: the accepted segment begins at race time 240, ends at 6567, contains 6,328 consecutive stage-2 samples, and is followed by stage 4. A later incomplete segment is the retail automatic replay loop.
- A rejected partial launch accidentally entered the first local Nintendo WFC privacy-notice screen. No agreement or network action occurred; the process was closed and its partial trace moved recoverably to Trash before this fresh offline run.
- The private accepted log SHA-256 is `596da9664cf1288d30f3d4b950b05066d22ae6167c0ab4d64c02556a15b17e89`. Bounded audio telemetry is clean through 106,496 checks and 40,894,080 submitted bytes, with zero empty observations/drops and a 14,296-byte maximum below the 15,360-byte limit. Broader row 33 scope remains open.

- Strict assertion: `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 10349`.
- Result: the accepted segment begins at race time 240, ends at 10348, contains 10,109 consecutive stage-2 samples, and is followed by stage 4. A later incomplete segment is the retail automatic replay loop.
- Ice, snow, water reflections, penguins, and transparent ghost rendering remained intact. GUI sampling observed temporary readings around 45–54 FPS under host load; this is retained as a performance observation.
- Private log SHA-256 `e08a09425dcf787670131e761000c25b23c3bb1afa90f5a2e74ef1fd9812d0af` recorded 14 audio-queue drops, so this run is rejected from audio-row acceptance.

## SNES Mario Circuit 3 exact run

- Product: sole native arm64 KartPad process launched with the process-local trace helper; no Dolphin and no Simulator.
- Test precondition: the user's own private all-cups fixture documented in `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-all-cups-fixture.md`. This enables track access only and is not progression evidence.
- Executable SHA-256: `fa86a907ca2bebbc72eec1baf02cd83f3ceb816e584e33ed3dd23926ab945545`.
- Retail UI path: Time Trials → Lightning Cup → SNES Mario Circuit 3 → regular Nintendo staff data `Nin★iwaco 01:38.880` → Watch Replay.

- Strict assertion: `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 6167`.
- Result: the accepted segment begins at race time 240, ends at 6166, contains 5,927 consecutive stage-2 samples, and is followed by stage 4. A separate 74-frame unfinished segment is ignored; the later incomplete segment is the retail automatic replay loop.
- Focused observations displayed 60 FPS through flat-color geometry, barriers, transparency, and boost effects. Private log SHA-256 `bcbc782c220fad8fb0850d9540d37f2eaf7f46ffcf0ff045ef069c958f55aec7` recorded 17 audio-queue drops, rejected from audio-row acceptance.

## Daisy Circuit exact run

- Product: sole native arm64 KartPad process launched with the process-local trace helper; no Dolphin and no Simulator.
- Test precondition: the user's own private all-cups fixture documented in `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-all-cups-fixture.md`; progression acceptance remains separate.
- Executable SHA-256: `fa86a907ca2bebbc72eec1baf02cd83f3ceb816e584e33ed3dd23926ab945545`.
- Retail UI path: Time Trials → Star Cup → Daisy Circuit → regular Nintendo staff data `Nin★Toki 01:56.822` → Watch Replay.
