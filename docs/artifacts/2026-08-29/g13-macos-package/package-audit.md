# G13 macOS static package audit

Date: 2026-08-29

Classification: **Pass for the build/link/package audit subcase.** Launch, relocated-storage mutation, and gameplay verification of this exact package remain open and are not claimed here.

## Candidate identity

- Source commit: `17cee52d92b70b73e8216a8469dfba668cf4022d`
- Generated runtime SHA-256 before packaging: `4c12eadfd5edf0dd106b76692bef82d8162026684969c7b498a0d3a830f4a0a5`
- Runtime SHA-256 after the package-time `@rpath` load-command update and before signing: `544e47f42718db5894127cef7712374d2fd871a6cac55645a87a0b6ec6af2303`
- Signed packaged executable SHA-256: `05f868bc6826ee009356abc236e9ce507a123e687d86ced0fb33665ab1a11d36`
- App icon SHA-256: `2c83d844e0fe895cae99bc4ed8ea976a969b3035833373c39af31247b17ea7b8`
- Bundle-content audit hash: `8a8ff8b38aa699070f3e6ad20a251a4adafb0a3d5cdb7df71aed90bacecbd602`
- Bundle identifier: `dev.kartpad.app`
- App version/build: `0.1.0` / `1`
- Package size: 80 MiB

## Commands

```text
cmake -S build/g7-game-runtime-source -B build/g7-game-runtime-build -G Ninja \
  -DMKW_TRANSLATED_SHARD_MANIFEST=<private>/g8-full-translation/build_shards/shards.cmake \
  -DMKW_TRANSLATED_COMPILE_JOBS=2
cmake --build build/g7-game-runtime-build --target WiiCompiled --parallel 8
scripts/package-macos-runtime.sh <runtime-build> <KartPad.app>
scripts/audit-macos-package.sh <KartPad.app>
```

The first static-link attempt was rejected because configuration incorrectly retained the older G6 translation manifest and failed on missing `func_8055531C`. The function exists in the authoritative 29,637-function G8 full-title graph. Changing only the manifest to the full graph produced a successful link; no stub or semantic bypass was added. The preparation script now defaults to that full graph.

## Observed audit results

- Mach-O architecture: arm64.
- `LC_BUILD_VERSION`: platform macOS, minimum 14.0, SDK 26.5.
- Dynamic dependencies: Apple system frameworks plus `/usr/lib` only; no Homebrew, SDL, libpng, FreeType, Abseil, or other developer-machine dylib remains.
- First-party compile paths are redacted; the executable contains no path under the builder's home directory.
- The app contains the DSP coefficient ROM, transferable initial pipeline cache, Wii first-run bootstrap, and original ICNS.
- The app contains no `portable.txt`, `UserData`, `Config.toml`, WBFS, ISO, RVZ, WIA, or GCZ.
- `codesign --verify --deep --strict` passes for the ad-hoc signed bundle.
- `plutil -lint` passes; package and executable both declare macOS 14.0.
- Repository safety audit and patch dry-run against the pinned WiiCompiled source pass.

## Static-source archive verification

The static build initially inherited unhashed tag archives for Abseil 20240722.0 and SDL 3.4.4. KartPad now predeclares those two FetchContent inputs with SHA-256 before Aurora configures them:

- Abseil: `f50e5ac311a81382da7fa75b97310e4b9006474f9560ac46f54a9967f07d4ae3`
- SDL: `ee712dbe6a89bb140bbfc2ce72358fb5ee5cc2240abeabd54855012db30b3864`

CMake's generated URL metadata records both expected hashes, and the downloaded archive bytes match. Reconfiguration succeeded, Ninja reported no work, and the generated runtime remained byte-identical at `4c12eadfd5edf0dd106b76692bef82d8162026684969c7b498a0d3a830f4a0a5`. The already-hashed Dawn, libpng, FreeType, xxHash, fmt, ImGui, SQLite, zstd, and Tracy inputs remain unchanged.

The app bundle is an ignored local artifact and is not published to Git. It will not be launched while the single long-session gameplay process is active.
